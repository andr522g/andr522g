# Hi, I'm André Pelle Rashid 👋

## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

I'm a Software Engineering student at Aarhus University (Diplomingeniør i Softwareteknologi, 2023–2027).

I’m a curious and dedicated developer who enjoys solving complex problems and turning ideas into structured, well-designed software solutions. I see challenges as opportunities to grow — both technically and personally.

I’m currently seeking an internship where I can further develop my skills, contribute with engagement and teamwork, and grow into a great software engineer.

## 🚀 What Am I Currently Working On?

I am currently expanding my knowledge through the following university courses:

### 🌐 Web Architecture and Orchestration  
This course focuses on designing and building distributed web systems, with particular emphasis on microservices and scalable architectures. I am learning how to structure service-based systems, manage communication between components, and orchestrate distributed applications to ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

### 🔐 IT Security  
In this course, I am developing a strong understanding of cybersecurity principles such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. I am learning how to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and implement secure solutions in software systems, including authentication, encryption, and secure communication practices.

### 🤖 Machine Learning  
This course introduces methods for enabling systems to learn from data. I am working with core machine learning concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, and data preprocessing. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation to understand how intelligent systems are built and evaluated.
